Comments to the Author
This paper describes the analysis of the effects of dark and light phases in cyanobacteria by monitoring the level of supercoiling of plasmids using chloroquine-agarose gel electrophoresis.  The work is aimed at addressing inconsistencies about this question in the literature.  Initially the authors summarise the background to DNA topoisomer resolution using agarose gels and go on to illustrate the methodology using plasmid pUC19 in vitro.  They then go on to investigate diurnal plasmid supercoiling in Synechocystis using this methodology.
There are apparent discrepancies in the literature relating to the supercoiling state of plasmids in Synechocystis and it is useful for the current authors to seek to address these.  However, it is important that this is done well in order that readers are convinced that the issues have been resolved.  In my opinion this has not been done, and additionally I am not convinced that the present work is sufficient of an advance to warrant publication.
Specific comments:
1. The primer on topoisomer separation on pp. 2-3 is OK, but needs to be a lot better to serve a good purpose.  There are classic reviews by Bauer and colleagues that are not cited (1-4), which cover this territory, and also a text book (5) that contains all the information needed.  Specific comments:
a. No mention of Lk = Tw + Wr
b. Supercoiling density should be referred to a ‘specific linking difference’.
c. It should be clearly stated that intercalators reduce the twist of ccDNA.
2. The pUC19 experiment in Fig. 1 is very odd.  pUC19 is small (2686 bp) and typically, due to the Gaussian nature of the topoisomer distribution, only ~5-6 topoisomers are visible.  This is indeed the case in some lanes, e.g. ‘100’ and ‘200’.  However, in other lanes many more can be seen, e.g. about 12 in ‘500’.  This is hard to explain given the methods used and no explanation is given.
3. Fig. 2 shows the only original result in the paper and is unclear and hard to follow.  The bands in panel A are really faint and the gels would benefit from labelling of the topoisomers.  As a consequence, the results illustrated are unconvincing.

Comments to the Author
The manuscript by Rudiger and coworkers entitled "Plasmid supercoiling decreases during the dark phase in cyanobacteria: a clarification of the interpretation of chloroquine- agarose gels" is an examination of a discrepancy between two studies in the interpretation of circadian-mediated supercoiling in cyanobacteria. Although there is no new conceptual advance in this manuscript, the resolution of these reported discrepancies is worthwhile, and BIOLOGY METHODS & PROTOCOLS is an appropriate journal for this contribution.

Despite the fact that the authors are testing a completely different species (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) from the Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 species examined by the previous studies (Woelfle et al. and Vijayan et al.), their analysis and conclusions are reasonable that the Woelfle et al. study misinterpreted the negative/positive supercoiling directions (however, another experiment is necessary to confirm this point----see issue #7 below). Nevertheless, the original main point of both studies (that there is a circadian rhythm of supercoiling) is not altered by the Rudiger et al. study. Moreover, the manuscript is its current form is incomplete.

Central issues:

1. In the paragraph on page 5 beginning with line 16, the authors suggest that supercoiling-dependent conformations of circular DNA could be to some degree sequence dependent. Could there also be a size dependence of plasmid DNA molecules? In the next section, they discuss the three plasmids contained in 6803; the authors chose to follow the topoisomer patterns of pCA2.4. This plasmid is similar in size to pUC19 (2.4 vs. 2.7 Kb) which seems like a reasonable choice, but do not discuss anything in terms of sequence similarity (A-T, G-C content). Moreover, this plasmid is significantly smaller than the pANS (7.8 Kb) used in the 7942 studies. Do these differences complicate the comparisons? Explain why or why not.

2. Figure 2: The authors used plasmids cut with NcoI to show where the linear form of the plasmid migrates. It seems to me that the topoisomer smears are running faster than the linear form which is not what they saw in the gels using pUC19. They also do not indicate where the open circular form is migrating; topoisomers should migrate between the linear form and the OC form. Explain.

3. Figure 2A/B: according to the legend for Fig. 2D (page 6, lines 32-33), there is only a single replicate at 1 ug/ml chloroquine and 3 replicates at 20 ug/ml. The authors need to replicate their own experiment at 1 ug/ml chloroquine so that they can confidently conclude that the plasmid DNA is more negatively supercoiled during the light phase than during the dark phase.

4. Figure 2C is an electropherogram of an example lane in an attempt to quantify the data in Figs. 2A and 2B. What lane from what gel? Why was that lane chosen? Clarify.

5. Figure 2D is plot of mean change in linking number deficit (deltaLk) vs. time. The authors say that the absolute value of deltaLk is an estimate based on the distance to the relaxed forms after Topoisomerase I relaxation (not shown) and are likely underestimates. These "not shown" data should be shown (or at least a sample). The authors include a mean deltaLk and with standard deviation error bars; are these error bars based on data from BOTH 1 ug/ml and 20 ug/ml chloroquine gels ? (since they only have a single replicate at 1 ug/ml).

6. The authors spend a great deal of time talking about Keller’s band counting method as being the optimal method for determining the true deltaLk , then in the very last paragraph of the Materials and Methods (page 9, line 37), they say that they used a less optimal estimate of deltaLk. Why? If the reason is because the authors could not generate appropriate data to use the band counting method, this seems like a "double standard" as they criticize the interpretations of other studies.

7. Woelfle et al reported supercoiling data from light/dark cycles (LD) and constant light (LL) conditions, while Vijayan et al reported only LL. The current authors report LD and constant darkness (DD). In order to make an adequate comparison among the three publications, the authors need to report LL to demonstrate (1) that the authors’ interpretations render all three studies to be consistent with each other, and (2) and to confirm that the two different species (7942 and 6803) are doing the same thing, namely that they are exhibiting a circadian rhythm of supercoiling.

Minor points:

A. page 1, line 48 (and again on page 6, line 53): “an old method”----why the adjective “old” ? It sounds pejorative, as though the method isn’t worth considering because it is old. If that is true, who cares about the current manuscript either? I suggest the authors rephrase to something like “. . . a well documented method . . . .”

B. Figure 1. the labels for the MW size standards need to be clearer (use larger font and sharper resolution).

Comments to the Author
This is an excellent paper! I agree with the new interpretation of results from two previously published PNAS articles (PMID: 18000054 and 20018699) by this paper. The supercoiled DNA (SC) molecules in Figs. 1-3 of PMID 18000054 are not supercoiled DNA. It is likely that these DNA molecules are denatured DNA or some other DNA molecules. The more negatively supercoiled DNA topoisomers migrated slower in the CQ gels at the CQ concentrations of 10 or 15 ug/mL. I have a concern regarding Fig. 1. What is the purpose to relax DNA (pUC19) in the presence of CQ. I think that EB is more appropriate since the EB concentration can be precisely determined (the extinction coefficient of EB is 5600 M-1 cm-1). EB is a strong intercalator with an unwitting angle of 26 degrees and binds to DNA more tightly. It does not strongly inhibit E. coli or eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I.
