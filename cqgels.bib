                   robust circadian (daily) rhythms under the control of
                   the KaiABC-based core clockwork. Unlike eukaryotic
                   circadian systems characterized thus far, the
                   cyanobacterial clockwork modulates gene expression
                   patterns globally and specific clock gene promoters
                   are not necessary in mediating the circadian feedback
                   loop. The oscilloid model postulates that global
                   rhythms of transcription are based on rhythmic
                   changes in the status of the cyanobacterial
                   chromosome that are ultimately controlled by the
                   KaiABC oscillator. By using a nonessential, cryptic
                   plasmid (pANS) as a reporter of the superhelical
                   state of DNA in cyanobacteria, we show that the
                   supercoiling status of this plasmid changes in a
                   circadian manner in vivo. The rhythm of topological
                   change in the plasmid is conditional; this change is
                   rhythmic in constant light and in light/dark cycles,
                   but not in constant darkness. In further support of
                   the oscilloid model, cyanobacterial promoters that
                   are removed from their native chromosomal locations
                   and placed on a plasmid preserve their circadian
                   expression patterns.},

                   conditions. The mechanism underlying these
                   oscillations remains elusive--neither cis nor

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: The transcriptomes of several
                   cyanobacterial strains have been shown to exhibit
                   diurnal oscillation patterns, reflecting the diurnal
                   phototrophic lifestyle of the organisms.The analysis
                   of such genome-wide transcriptional oscillations is
                   often facilitated by the use of clustering algorithms
                   in conjunction with a number of pre-processing steps.
                   Biological interpretation is usually focussed on the
                   time and phase of expression of the resulting groups
                   of genes.However, the use of microarray technology in
                   such studies requires the normalization of
                   pre-processing data, with unclear impact on the
                   qualitative and quantitative features of the derived
                   information on the number of oscillating transcripts
                   and their respective phases. RESULTS: A microarray
                   based evaluation of diurnal expression in the
                   cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is
                   presented. As expected, the temporal expression
                   patterns reveal strong oscillations in transcript
                   abundance.We compare the Fourier transformation-based
                   expression phase before and after the application of
                   quantile normalization, median polishing, cyclical
                   LOESS, and least oscillating set (LOS)
                   normalization.Whereas LOS normalization mostly
                   preserves the phases of the raw data, the remaining
                   methods introduce systematic biases. In particular,
                   quantile-normalization is found to introduce a
                   phase-shift of 180 degrees , effectively changing
                   night-expressed genes into day-expressed ones.
                   Comparison of a large number of clustering results of
                   differently normalized data shows that the
                   normalization method determines the result.
                   Subsequent steps, such as the choice of data
                   transformation, similarity measure, and clustering
                   algorithm, only play minor roles.We find that the
                   standardization and the DTF transformation are
                   favorable for the clustering of time series in
                   contrast to the 12m transformation. We use the
                   cluster-wise functional enrichment of a clustering
                   derived by LOS normalization, clustering using
                   flowClust, and DFT transformation to derive the
                   diurnal biological program of Synechocystis sp..
                   CONCLUSION: Application of quantile normalization,
                   median polishing, and also cyclic LOESS normalization
                   of the presented cyanobacterial dataset lead to
                   increased numbers of oscillating genes and the
                   systematic shift of the expression phase. The LOS
                   normalization minimizes the observed detrimental
                   effects. As previous analyses employed a variety of
                   different normalization methods, a direct comparison
                   of results must be treated with caution.},

                   close to 24 h. These cellular clocks allow organisms
                   to anticipate the environmental cycles of day and
                   night by synchronizing circadian rhythms with the
                   rising and setting of the sun. These rhythms
                   originate from the oscillator components of circadian
                   clocks and control global gene expression and various
                   cellular processes. The oscillator of photosynthetic
                   cyanobacteria is composed of three proteins, KaiA,
                   KaiB, and KaiC, linked to a complex regulatory
                   network. Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 possesses
                   the standard cyanobacterial kaiABC gene cluster plus
                   multiple kaiB and kaiC gene copies and antisense RNAs
                   for almost every kai transcript. However, there is no
                   clear evidence of circadian rhythms in Synechocystis
                   sp. PCC 6803 under various experimental conditions.
                   It is also still unknown if and to what extent the
                   multiple kai gene copies and kai antisense RNAs
                   affect circadian timing. Moreover, a large number of
                   small noncoding RNAs whose accumulation dynamics over
                   time have not yet been monitored are known for
                   Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Here we performed a 48-h
                   time series transcriptome analysis of Synechocystis
                   sp. PCC 6803, taking into account periodic light-dark
                   phases, continuous light, and continuous darkness. We
                   found that expression of functionally related genes
                   occurred in different phases of day and night.
                   Moreover, we found day-peaking and night-peaking
                   transcripts among the small RNAs; in particular, the
                   amounts of kai antisense RNAs correlated or
                   anticorrelated with those of their respective kai
                   target mRNAs, pointing toward the regulatory
                   relevance of these antisense RNAs. Surprisingly, we
                   observed that the amounts of 16S and 23S rRNAs in
                   this cyanobacterium fluctuated in light-dark periods,
                   showing maximum accumulation in the dark phase.
                   Importantly, the amounts of all transcripts,
                   including small noncoding RNAs, did not show any
                   rhythm under continuous light or darkness, indicating
                   the absence of circadian rhythms in Synechocystis.},

                   of the 5.2-kbp plasmid, pCC5.2, has been analyzed and
                   is reported here. This plasmid contains 5214 bp and
                   53.1\% A+T. Six open reading frames, ORFs A-F
                   (encoding peptides of larger than 90 amino acid
                   residues), were located on both strands of pCC5.2.
                   ORF B codes for a potential replication protein
                   containing 971 amino acids, for which there are three
                   homologous proteins encoded by other cyanobacterial
                   plasmids. ORF C encodes a polypeptide of 93 amino
                   acids which shares homologies with products of two
                   ORFs found in the protein database. Counterparts of
                   the products of ORF A, D, E, and F could not be found
                   in the protein database. Detection of a
                   single-stranded DNA intermediate during replication
                   of pCC5.2 indicates that this plasmid may also
                   replicate by a rolling circle mechanism, as has been
                   reported for pCA2.4 and pCB2.4 from the same strain
                   of Synechocystis (PCC 6803).},
