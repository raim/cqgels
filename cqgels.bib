                   transcription are interdependent because the movement
                   of a transcription elongation complex simultaneously
                   induces under- and overwinding of the DNA duplex and
                   because the initiation, elongation and termination
                   steps of transcription are all sensitive to the
                   topological state of the DNA. RESULTS: Policing of
                   the local and global supercoiling of DNA by
                   topoisomerases helps to sustain the major DNA-based
                   transactions by eliminating barriers to the movement
                   of transcription complexes and replisomes. Recent
                   data from whole-genome and single-molecule studies
                   have provided new insights into how interactions
                   between transcription and the supercoiling of DNA
                   influence the architecture of the chromosome and how
                   they create cell-to-cell diversity at the level of
                   gene expression through transcription bursting.
                   CONCLUSIONS: These insights into fundamental
                   molecular processes reveal mechanisms by which
                   bacteria can prevail in unpredictable and often
                   hostile environments by becoming unpredictable
                   themselves.},

                   encode the functional protein core of the timing
                   mechanism essential for circadian clock regulation of
                   global gene expression. The Kai proteins comprise the
                   central timing mechanism, and the sensor kinase SasA
                   is a primary transducer of temporal information. We
                   demonstrate that the circadian clock also regulates a
                   chromosome compaction rhythm. This chromosome
                   compaction rhythm is both circadian clock-controlled
                   and kai-dependent. Although sasA is required for
                   global gene expression rhythmicity, it is not
                   required for these chromosome compaction rhythms. We
                   also demonstrate direct control by the Kai proteins
                   on the rate at which the SasA protein
                   autophosphorylates. Thus, to generate and maintain
                   circadian rhythms in gene expression, the Kai
                   proteins keep relative time, communicate temporal
                   information to SasA, and may control access to
                   promoter elements by imparting rhythmic chromosome
                   compaction.},

                   circadian systems characterized thus far, the
                   cyanobacterial clockwork modulates gene expression
                   patterns globally and specific clock gene promoters
                   are not necessary in mediating the circadian feedback
                   loop. The oscilloid model postulates that global
                   rhythms of transcription are based on rhythmic
                   changes in the status of the cyanobacterial
                   chromosome that are ultimately controlled by the
                   KaiABC oscillator. By using a nonessential, cryptic
                   plasmid (pANS) as a reporter of the superhelical
                   state of DNA in cyanobacteria, we show that the

                   change in the plasmid is conditional; this change is
                   rhythmic in constant light and in light/dark cycles,
                   but not in constant darkness. In further support of

                   and placed on a plasmid preserve their circadian

                   amounts of ethidium bromide (EtdBr). After removal of

                   mobility was a function of the number of superhelical

                   probably a consequence of thermal fluctuations in the
                   DNA helix at the time when the last phospholiester
                   bond is closed in vivo. When correlated to the
                   buoyant shift of completely relaxed SV40 DNA in a
                   CsC1-propidium diiodide gradient, the number of delta
                   tau = 24 +/- 2 of superhelical versus relaxed DNA
                   implies an unwinding of the DNA helix by 26-28 degree

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: The transcriptomes of several
                   cyanobacterial strains have been shown to exhibit
                   diurnal oscillation patterns, reflecting the diurnal
                   phototrophic lifestyle of the organisms.The analysis
                   of such genome-wide transcriptional oscillations is
                   often facilitated by the use of clustering algorithms
                   in conjunction with a number of pre-processing steps.
                   Biological interpretation is usually focussed on the
                   time and phase of expression of the resulting groups
                   of genes.However, the use of microarray technology in
                   such studies requires the normalization of
                   pre-processing data, with unclear impact on the
                   qualitative and quantitative features of the derived
                   information on the number of oscillating transcripts
                   and their respective phases. RESULTS: A microarray
                   based evaluation of diurnal expression in the
                   cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is
                   presented. As expected, the temporal expression
                   patterns reveal strong oscillations in transcript
                   abundance.We compare the Fourier transformation-based
                   expression phase before and after the application of
                   quantile normalization, median polishing, cyclical
                   LOESS, and least oscillating set (LOS)
                   normalization.Whereas LOS normalization mostly
                   preserves the phases of the raw data, the remaining
                   methods introduce systematic biases. In particular,
                   quantile-normalization is found to introduce a
                   phase-shift of 180 degrees , effectively changing
                   night-expressed genes into day-expressed ones.
                   Comparison of a large number of clustering results of
                   differently normalized data shows that the
                   normalization method determines the result.
                   Subsequent steps, such as the choice of data
                   transformation, similarity measure, and clustering
                   algorithm, only play minor roles.We find that the
                   standardization and the DTF transformation are
                   favorable for the clustering of time series in
                   contrast to the 12m transformation. We use the
                   cluster-wise functional enrichment of a clustering
                   derived by LOS normalization, clustering using
                   flowClust, and DFT transformation to derive the
                   diurnal biological program of Synechocystis sp..
                   CONCLUSION: Application of quantile normalization,
                   median polishing, and also cyclic LOESS normalization
                   of the presented cyanobacterial dataset lead to
                   increased numbers of oscillating genes and the
                   systematic shift of the expression phase. The LOS
                   normalization minimizes the observed detrimental
                   effects. As previous analyses employed a variety of
                   different normalization methods, a direct comparison
                   of results must be treated with caution.},

  abstract =      {Many organisms harbor circadian clocks with periods
                   close to 24 h. These cellular clocks allow organisms
                   to anticipate the environmental cycles of day and
                   night by synchronizing circadian rhythms with the
                   rising and setting of the sun. These rhythms
                   originate from the oscillator components of circadian
                   clocks and control global gene expression and various
                   cellular processes. The oscillator of photosynthetic
                   cyanobacteria is composed of three proteins, KaiA,
                   KaiB, and KaiC, linked to a complex regulatory
                   network. Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 possesses
                   the standard cyanobacterial kaiABC gene cluster plus
                   multiple kaiB and kaiC gene copies and antisense RNAs
                   for almost every kai transcript. However, there is no
                   clear evidence of circadian rhythms in Synechocystis
                   sp. PCC 6803 under various experimental conditions.
                   It is also still unknown if and to what extent the
                   multiple kai gene copies and kai antisense RNAs
                   affect circadian timing. Moreover, a large number of
                   small noncoding RNAs whose accumulation dynamics over
                   time have not yet been monitored are known for
                   Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Here we performed a 48-h
                   time series transcriptome analysis of Synechocystis
                   sp. PCC 6803, taking into account periodic light-dark
                   phases, continuous light, and continuous darkness. We
                   found that expression of functionally related genes
                   occurred in different phases of day and night.
                   Moreover, we found day-peaking and night-peaking
                   transcripts among the small RNAs; in particular, the
                   amounts of kai antisense RNAs correlated or
                   anticorrelated with those of their respective kai
                   target mRNAs, pointing toward the regulatory
                   relevance of these antisense RNAs. Surprisingly, we
                   observed that the amounts of 16S and 23S rRNAs in
                   this cyanobacterium fluctuated in light-dark periods,
                   showing maximum accumulation in the dark phase.
                   Importantly, the amounts of all transcripts,
                   including small noncoding RNAs, did not show any
                   rhythm under continuous light or darkness, indicating
                   the absence of circadian rhythms in Synechocystis.},

9-aminoacridine and quinacrine had an essentially constant unwinding
angle of approximately 17 degrees at all ionic strengths tested.
The apparent unwinding angle for chloroquine and 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine
was found to be ionic strength dependent, increasing with increasing
ionic strength. This suggests that competitive nonintercalative
binding at low ionic strengths causes an apparent lowering of
the quinoline unwinding angle. This can also explain why 4-aminoquinaldine,
examined at low ionic strength, gives a quite low apparent unwinding
angle. Quinacrine along with chloroquinine and 9-aminoacridine
approaches a limiting value for their unwinding angle of approximately
17 degrees. 4-aminoquinaldine and 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine
could not be examined at an ionic strength above 0.03 because
of their very low equilibrium binding constants.}

constant of the DNA-chloroquine complex varied from 27 microM

results suggest that chloroquine binding to DNA is highly dependent

the antimalarial activity of chloroquine.}
