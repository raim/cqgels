* models vaccuum blotter and UV crosslinker,
* shorten background on CQ gels,
* nicer example figure and supplemental script for gel analysis.
* Supplement: show original gels, topoI experiment, elongatus
gels.
* Figure 2: enhance contrast of upper gel,
* mention that Beck et al. see no circadian component
in constant darkness,
* re-formulate more clearly:
""Figure 1 shows the relaxation experiment of pUC19. Addition of TopoI leads to a relaxation of pUC19, which decreases when CQ was present during the isomerization. With the addition of CQ to the gel, the supercoiled plasmids become relaxed and the TopoI-relaxed plasmids become positively supercoiled."
* unify use of SI units.
