Dear Prof. O'Shea and Prof. Johnson,

A few years ago I was inspired by your publications on the involvement
of DNA supercoiling in the diurnal and circadian gene expression in
cyanobacteria, Woelfle et al. 2007 [1] and Vijayan et al. 2009 [2], both in
PNAS. 

We have now published a preprint on our own analyses of DNA
supercoiling in *Synechocystis* [3], and I am in the process of submitting
this to a journal. However, there is a minor problem:

In this publication, we use chloroquine-agarose gel electrophoresis of
endogenous plasmids. We had established and adapted this method
starting from your two papers already some years ago. In fact that was
my short first foreage into wetlab work in Berlin, 2012-2013, in Ilka
Axmann's lab.  Back then we found that supercoiling quickly increases
upon onset of the light phase and continuously decreases during
prolonged dark phases. This is unfortunately the exact opposite of
data shown and statements made in Woelfle et al. 2007 for
*Synechococcus*.

We believe that this is due to a wrong interpretation of the differential
mobility of topoisomers at the employed chloroquine concentrations.

Since this is somewhat difficult to explain as a side note in our
recent paper, we have also put together a short manuscript focussing
only on these conflicting results and our re-interpretation of your
data sets, already published as a preprint [4]. There, we also note
that Vijayan et al. had reversed the interpretation already, but did
not discuss this anywhere.  Thus, this potential discrepancy between
your papers and the implied re-interpretatoin of some of the gels in
Woelfle et al. is not published anywhere. I think a clarification of
this may also re-spark the interest in this topic and your seminal
works on it.

Thus, I would be very glad to get some feedback from you. Are our
interpretations correct? Also: would you have any suggestion where
this methodological clarification could be published?

With kind regards,

Rainer Machne and Ilka Axmann
