Dear Editors,

We submit a manuscript for your consideration as a *Method
Article* in *Biology Methods and Protocols*:

Plasmid supercoiling decreases during the dark phase in cyanobacteria:
a clarification of the interpretation of chloroquine-agarose gels.
https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453679 

The paper describes an update to a very elegant classical method
[@Keller1975b], the separation of plasmid topoisomers by agarose gel
electrophoresis in the presence of a DNA intercalator. Measuring the
linking number of supercoiled plasmids was instrumental in
clarification of higher order DNA structures such as nucleosomes and
plectonemes in the 1970s-1980s. A lot of hands-on knowledge has since
been forgotten in standard microbiology laboratories.

The method has re-gained relevance since DNA supercoiling is currently
(again) researched for its basal role in regulation of bacterial
physiology.  Specifically, plasmid supercoiling varies during the
diurnal cycle of cyanobacteria [@Woelfle2007] and this correlates with
circadian clock-dependent genome-wide variation of transcription
[@Vijayan2009]. However, these two papers differ in their
interpretation of the gels, despite using very similar conditions. The
authors of the latter paper were aware of this conflicting
interpretation, but did not explicity mention it - one has to dig deep
into the Methods section and into the principles of topoisomer
separation in the presence of an intercalator, to understand this
fact. This is harmful for the field of circadian biology of
cyanobacteria, and should in our opinion be clarified.

In our case, we are currently working on a revision for Nucl Acids Res
(preprint: @Behle2021pre), where we rely on the correct interpretation
of these gels. It would be possible for us to just mention in the
Methods section, that we "determined mobility by varying chloroquine
variations (data not shown)" as many others do, or add an
under-determined supplemental figure.  However, Keller's band counting
method is a true gem in the history of DNA biology. We believe it
deserves an official review and update in the context of current
molecular biology, motivated by a specific case of mis-interpretation
in otherwise seminal publications.

Moreover, our manuscript is the first to describe an adaptation of
Keller's method to more modern standards, using the ubiquitous pUC19
plasmid and chloroquine instead of ethidium bromide (EtBr) as an
intercalator. Chloroquine is not only less toxic but also leads to a
cleaner separation of topoisomers than EtBR. We also outline how
the data can be analyzed with modern tools.

with best regards,
